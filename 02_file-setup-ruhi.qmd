## Video Tutorial

For every image you analyze: create a new folder and copy-and-paste your analyzed tables into it. Include  unique identifiers for the image such as animal/patient number and experimental condition, along with a unique tissue section id to help keep track of which folders contain each image. 

For this tutorial, use the tables you generated during FijiFISH Quantification, or use the tables found [here](https://figshare.com/account/projects/247085/articles/28911218) as well as in the [GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/kaitsull/RUHi/data). 

The FigShare and repo tables are done using the full-sized image data, and thus might yield better analysis results.
