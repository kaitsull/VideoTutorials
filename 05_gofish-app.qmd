## Running the `goFISH` Shiny App

This app allows users to previous and do basic analyses in a code-free manner. The app will work very slowly for multi-section analysis, but is a great first step in exploring individual images.

```r
######### STEP 3: ANALYZE WITH goFISH #########
#use your mFISH object and optionally select a gene to filter by or the number of clusters you would like

goFISH(myobj, filter.by="Slc17a7", k=5)

#when you are happy with the way your analysis looks, press "Download Object"
#to read back in your saved .RDS file, simply use:
myobj <- readRDS(path/to/object)

#you can then skip straight to the plotting steps - or redo other steps if you want
```
